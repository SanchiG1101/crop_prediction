# 🌾 Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate based on environmental conditions such as soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. It uses Python and machine learning to train classification models and analyze agricultural data.

## 🔍 Features Used
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- pH
- Rainfall (mm)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Algorithm**: Decision Tree Classifier

## 🧠 Workflow
1. Loaded and explored dataset using Pandas
2. Visualized data distribution with histograms and plots
3. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier for crop prediction
4. Evaluated model performance using accuracy score

## 🎯 Results
- Achieved good prediction performance using a Decision Tree model
- Made accurate crop recommendations based on test inputs
